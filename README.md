# RESTFul Blog App

To navigate to the app deployed on heroku, visit `https://sarpongdk-blog-app.herokuapp.com/blogs`


## Locally running the blog app
Note: all the commands show are to be executed in a terminal

To run the app, you will need:
	- Node, npm & mongod
Node can be installed using the command:
`brew install node`

Likewise mongodb can be installed via:
`brew install mongodb`

Clone this repository into a directory and run the commands in the terminal:
- `cd <directory-name>`
- `npm install`
- `mongod` to start the mongodb daemon.
- `node app.js` on a different terminal to start the application

## Potential Improvements
1. User registration and user accounts, with blogs attached to each account
2. User authentication and authorization
